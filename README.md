# 🖼️ Image Classification with CNN on CIFAR-10 using TensorFlow

## 🔎 Overview

This project demonstrates **image classification** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built with **TensorFlow and Keras** on the **CIFAR-10 dataset**. CIFAR-10 contains **60,000 32x32 RGB images** across **10 categories** such as airplanes, cars, birds, cats, and dogs.

The notebook `image-classification-CNN-cifar10.ipynb` guides you through:

- Loading and preprocessing the CIFAR-10 dataset
- Designing and training a CNN model
- Evaluating model performance with accuracy and loss metrics
- Visualizing predictions on sample images

This project showcases how deep learning can automatically learn image features and make accurate predictions, providing a practical introduction to CNNs and TensorFlow for image recognition.
