# 🖼️ Image Classification with CNN on CIFAR-10

A simple **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built with **TensorFlow and Keras** to classify images from the **CIFAR-10 dataset** (60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes like airplane, car, cat, etc.).

The notebook `image-classification-CNN-cifar10.ipynb` covers:

- Loading and preprocessing CIFAR-10
- Building and training a CNN
- Evaluating performance and visualizing results

If you want, I can **also make an even snappier “one-paragraph overview”** that fits right at the top for instant readability. Do you want me to do that?
